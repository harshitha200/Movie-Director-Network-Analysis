Analyzed an IMDb-like dataset containing movies and their directors by representing it as a graph network. It leverages graph theory and algorithmic techniques to perform network traversal, find shortest paths, and identify strongly connected components.

The goal is to demonstrate practical application of algorithms to real-world datasets, ensuring efficient data handling and accurate results through sample test cases.

**Algorithms Used & Purpose**

**1.Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

Traverses the network layer by layer.

Useful for exploring all reachable directors from a given starting point.

**2.Depth-First Search (DFS)**

Recursively explores paths in the network.

Checks for existence of paths between directors and analyzes connectivity.

**3.Dijkstra’s Algorithm**

Finds the shortest path between two directors.

Provides the path, cumulative distance, and number of hops.

**4.Kosaraju’s Algorithm**

Identifies Strongly Connected Components (SCCs).

Highlights clusters of directors that are mutually connected.
